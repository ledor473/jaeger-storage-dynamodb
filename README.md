# jaeger-storage-dynamodb

This repository contains a proof of concept to use DynamoDB as a datastore for [Jaeger](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger).

It's archived now because the PoC was using [Go plugin](https://golang.org/pkg/plugin/) and a [gRPC approach](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/tree/v1.19.2/plugin/storage/grpc) was preferred. Details can still be found [here](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1050)
